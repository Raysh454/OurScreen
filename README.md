# OurScreen

### Description

This program takes a snapshot of the entire screen when run and sends it over to discord (or anywhere really if you modify the url in the code) through a web hook. I used [LodePNG](https://lodev.org/lodepng/) to convert the image to PNG since discord doesn't allow viewing BMP.

### Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Open with Visual Studio
3. Enter the webhook path (First line in main function) of your own webhook
4. Compile and Run
